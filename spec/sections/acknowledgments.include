Acknowledgments {#acks}
=======================

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

This specification was developed with input from contributors who reviewed drafts and provided feedback. The design was informed by related work including [[BEADS]], which uses JSONL for git-backed structured storage.

The notation conventions used in the [[#api]] section were inspired by [[RFC9622]], which provides a model for describing abstract interfaces in a language-agnostic manner.

AI assistance disclosure {#ai-assistance}
-----------------------------------------

The development of this specification involved the use of AI language models, specifically Claude (Anthropic). AI tools contributed to the following aspects of this work:

* Drafting and refining specification prose
* Reviewing document structure and consistency
* Generating test case scenarios
* Exploring edge cases and potential ambiguities in the design

All normative requirements, technical design decisions, and final specification text were determined by human authors. AI-generated content was reviewed, edited, and validated against the specification's design goals. The authors take full responsibility for the technical accuracy and correctness of this document.

This disclosure is provided in the interest of transparency regarding modern specification development practices.
