Introduction {#intro}
=====================

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

A JSONLT file contains a sequence of operations—insertions and deletions—rather than a snapshot of current state. The [=logical state=] of the table (the current set of records after all operations have been applied; see [[#logical-state]]) is computed by replaying these operations in order. This append-only design ensures that modifications produce minimal diffs when the file is tracked in version control.

Purpose {#purpose}
------------------

JSONLT provides a lightweight, portable format for storing keyed records that:

* Is human-readable and editable with standard text tools
* Produces clean diffs in version control systems
* Supports concurrent access through file locking
* Requires no external database or service

Scope {#scope}
--------------

This specification defines:

* The physical file format (encoding, line structure, JSON representation)
* The logical data model (keys, records, operations, state)
* Processing algorithms (parsing, serialization, compaction)
* An abstract interface for implementations
* Concurrency and transaction semantics
